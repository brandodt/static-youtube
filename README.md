# Static YouTube

This is a school project for ITEC50A, where the task was to create a static webpage for YouTube without using any frameworks. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the ability to manually code a YouTube-like interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The **Static YouTube** project provides a simplified replica of the YouTube interface, allowing users to browse videos, search for specific content, and watch videos. Although it is a static webpage, it mimics the appearance and basic functionality of YouTube.

## Features

- **Home Page:** The landing page displays a collection of featured videos, showcasing the project's design and layout.
- **Video Playback:** When a user clicks on a video thumbnail or title, they are taken to the video playback page, where they can watch the selected video.
- **Library:** Users can access their personal video library, where they can save and organize their favorite videos.
- **History:** The project keeps track of the user's viewing history, allowing them to revisit previously watched videos.
- **Subscription:** Users can subscribe to their favorite channels and receive updates on new videos.
- **Google Register:** Users have the option to register
- **Google Login:** Registered users can log in

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML5:** The project's structure and content are built using HTML5.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout are implemented using CSS3, including media queries for responsiveness.
- **GitHub:** The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for version control and collaboration.
